## Update Details

### REMOTE CABIN PRECONDITIONING TEMPERATURE ADJUSTMENT
With the Rivian mobile app 1.7, you will be able to use the mobile app to adjust the remote cabin preconditioning temperature. This allows you to select the desired cabin temperature for when you return to your vehicle.

### NEW REAR ACCESSORY SETTING
When you have accessories installed on the rear tow hitch, you can now hide rear visual alerts and mute audio warnings while in reverse. To enable this feature, choose **Settings** from the menu on the center display, and then choose **Vehicle**. Choose **Driver+** and turn on **Rear accessory**.

### DRIVER+ SETTINGS ARE NOW PERSISTENT
Your Driver+ settings for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) / Highway Assist (HWA) distance, Forward Collision Warning Proximity settings, Lane Keeping Assist, Blind Spot Warning, Park Assist Audio Warnings, and Rear Cross-Traffic Warning will now persist across software updates and drive cycles.
> **Note**
> The Driver+ settings for Rear Cross-Traffic Warning, Park Assist Audio Warnings will default to factory settings after this software update, and after that will persist for future software updates.
