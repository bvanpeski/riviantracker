## Update Details

### New Camping App Available
For your convenience, you can now do the following:
* Energy use: To optimize your camping experience inside or outside the vehicle, choose your vehicle's energy use: Stay
Off, Normal, or Stay On.
* Outlets: 120 V, 12 V, USB-C, and the wireless charging pad stay on. The outlets can stay on for a maximum of 24 hours, with the option to choose a shorter duration.
* Camp courtesy: You can turn off exterior lights, vehicle sounds, proximity locking or unlocking, and the Gear Guard
alarm sound. This also enables quiet cooling or heating.

Camping controls, except for the outlets, are available only when the vehicle is in Park. Choose **Camping** from the menu on the center display.

### RANGE NOW VIEWABLE AS PERCENTAGE OF STATE OF CHARGE
For the range estimate on the driver display, you can set the state of charge to show distance, percentage, or both.
Choose **Settings** from the menu on the center display, and then choose **Vehicle**. Choose **Units**. Under **Range in Driver Display**, choose the distance, **%** (percentage), or **Both**.
