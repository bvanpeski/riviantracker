## Update Details

### ROOMY ENTRY AND EXIT
Roomy entry and exit allows the driver's seat and steering wheel to automatically adjust between a preferred driving position and a preferred entry or exit position, for easier access at the beginning and end of a drive. The setting and the preferred entry and exit positions are saved to your specific user profile. This feature is disabled by default.

To use Roomy entry and exit, choose **Settings** from the menu on the center display. Choose **Vehicle**, then choose **Access**, and then follow the prompts on your screen.

>**NOTE**
>If your seat or steering wheel is not calibrated, the Roomy Entry & Exit setting and automatic driving position adjustments will not be available. Please contact Rivian Service to get the seat or steering wheel calibrated.

### SHIFT TO NEUTRAL FEATURE FOR CAR WASH MODE
When Car Wash mode is enabled and the vehicle is not in neutral, a "Shift to Neutral" button appears to allow for easier neutral access when moving forward in a drive-through car wash. Press the brake pedal to allow the shift to Neutral.
