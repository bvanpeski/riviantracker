## Update Details

### Automatic Ride Height
We have added the ability to enable automatic or manual ride height control to **All Purpose** and **Conserve** modes. When the ride height is set to Auto, the vehicle automatically changes to Low ride height at higher speeds for increased efficiency and energy conservation. The vehicle returns to Standard ride height at lower speeds for increased ground clearance and comfort.

Conserve Auto mode has now the same ride height strategy as All Purpose, and hence reduces the amount of suspension auto-adjustment when approaching stop lights in urban environments.

To turn off automatic ride height changes in All-Purpose or Conserve mode, manually select another available ride height.
These manual settings are now latching across drive cycles.

### Direct Current Fast Charging
We have improved DC fast charging performance and battery preconditioning when using trip planner. In ideal conditions, you may experience up to a 20% improvement in miles added per minute.
