# Rivian Shortcuts & Tips

## Logging Events
When experiencing a weird issue with the truck, hit your Hazard lights at the time the issue occurs. Communicate this in your ticket, as it makes it easier for a technician going through the vehicle logs to pinpoint the time the issue started occuring more precisely.

## Reset Procedures
**Sleep Reset**
Rivian must be unplugged from charger, nothing plugged into any USB ports, Inverter off, all seatbelts unbuckled, no one in the vehicle. Then lock and walk away for at least 30 minutes.

**Infotainment Reset**
Hold the far left and far right buttons on the steering wheel for about 15 seconds. This fixes issues having to do with the screens, hotspots, Alexa not working, glitchy navigation, etc.

**Full Reset**
Hold the far left button on the steering wheel and the emergency flasher button for about 15 seconds. The entire computer will restart.
According to Rivian support DO NOT RESET AGAIN FOR AT LEAST 1 HOUR after this procedure. There are multiple systems that may take a bit longer to fully come up after this reset.
